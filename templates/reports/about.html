        <div class="about-hero mb-5">
            <p class="lead text-center">SafeRoute is a community-powered platform designed to improve personal safety and awareness in cities and towns in Kenya.</p>
        </div>

        <section class="mb-5">
            <p>Every day, women face risks such as unsafe roads, insecure shortcuts, suspicious activity, harassment hotspots, poorly lit zones, and general insecurity. Yet most of this information is never reported or is shared too late.</p>
            
            <p class="mt-3"><strong>Our mission is simple: give women the power to see danger before they walk into it.</strong></p>

        <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="mb-3">How It Works</h2>
            <p>Using crowdsourced reports from everyday users, SafeRoute Kenya generates a live Safety Heatmap that highlights risk zones, incident-prone areas, and recent alerts. Users can post pictures of unsafe locations, suspicious activity, or areas needing improvement (such as unsafe pedestrian paths, blackspots, etc.). The platform organizes this information into clear visual markers that help others make safer decisions.</p>

        <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="mb-3">Our Commitment</h2>
            <p><strong>We are not a replacement for emergency services</strong>—rather, we are a tool that empowers women with real-time awareness so they can avoid danger, protect loved ones, and raise concerns early.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="mb-3">Technology & Values</h2>
            <p>SafeRoute is built on transparency, community collaboration, and digital innovation. With modern web technologies, secure data handling, and user-driven reporting, we aim to redefine how communities share safety information.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-5 text-center">
            <h2 class="mb-3">Our Vision</h2>
            <p class="lead"><strong>Together, we can build safer neighborhoods, safer cities, and safer futures for all.</strong></p>
